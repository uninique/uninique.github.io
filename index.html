"Kosher salt"],
  instructions: ["Blanch the edamame. To a pot of boiling water, dump in the frozen edamame along with a generous pinch of kosher salt.

"Make the dressing. Add the toasted sesame seeds, honey, ginger, and chili crisp to a heat-proof bowl or jar. Heat the sesame oil in a pan on high heat until it shimmers and looks watery (this is a good indicator the oil is hot, but hasn’t burnt). Pour the oil over the bowl of aromatics – this will flash cook the raw ginger and amplify the flavors of everything. Stir well.", 
"Finish and serve. Pour the dressing over the salad, sprinkle over a generous pinch of salt and toss to combine. Adjust for salt as needed and serve immediately. Serve with a sticky teriyaki (or chili crisp) fish like salmon, pair with sticky short-grain rice, or top with crispy rice for crunch."]
